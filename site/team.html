            <p>Emma Leiner is an IEOR graduate student from France. She studied computer science and applied mathematics back in Paris and is currently doing her Master's at Berkeley. As a big fan of sports, she's investing most of her free time in Cali running, swimming, windsurfing and enjoying the Berkeley lifestyle, before her trip back home in May 2019.</p>

            <p>Maria Marinaki, mostly known as Marikita, studies IEOR at UC Berkeley as a graduate student. Her Bachelor’s degree was in Chemical Engineering with a focus on Biomedical Engineering. There you could find her mostly in the lab conducting experiments or volunteering at student organizations. Now, she is exploring the world of Data Science while pretending to live a balanced lifestyle.</p>

            <p>Brandon Berookhim is from Los Angeles, California, where he was born, raised, and attended school. He started at UC Berkeley in 2015 and is pursuing simultaneous degrees in Computer Science and Business Administration. He is a Director at Cal Hacks and member of TAMID Group at Berkeley. Berookhim aspires to put his two degrees to use by founding an EdTech company to help improve education for everyone. When he is not coding or sleeping, he can be found zooming around Berkeley on his bike, Ruby, sipping on boba and listening to rap.</p>

            <p>Echo Hansen is a third-year student at UC Berkeley pursuing degrees in Cognitive Science and Art History. Specifically, her fields of study are computational modeling and queer theory in Modern art and her thesis explores the marginalization of queer and female architects in 20th century Europe following the rise of Modernism, delving into the issues arising from not only contemporary analyses and reception, but more recent, revisionist histories as well. She hopes to pursue a career in UX/UI, where she can combine her technical background with her understanding of art and visual culture in the digital age. Born in Brooklyn but raised in the Bay Area, Hansen now calls Berkeley home, and plans to spend the rest of her life in California with her bunny Hamilton, so she never has to confront her fear of the cold. In what little free time she does have, she knits and crochets (albeit, terribly), listens to weird, experimental bass, and spends excessive amounts of time and money in search of the world’s greatest breakfast burrito.</p>

            <p>Jenny Sokolsky is a third year studying Data Science and Political Economy. Originally from San Jose, she now calls Berkeley home, but still is absolutely in love with her only hometown sports team, the San Jose Sharks. When not coding or reading books, Jenny is also competitive ballroom dancer, and president of the ballroom team on campus. Though her free time is mostly consumed with watching hockey and sometimes sailing across the bay!</p>
